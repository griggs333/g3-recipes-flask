# G3 Recipes Database

---

This project is a small webapp designed to save and organize recipes.

It utilizes the Flask framework.


## Why
I am writing this app as an exercise to get some python practice (shake off the rust), learn a python web framework, get an introduction to databases, and learn some html and css syntax while building something I can actually use.

## Eventual Intended Features

- Navigation menu with categories
  - Meal type
  - Cuisine
  - Favorites
  - Source
- Search
- Administration page (with auth) with:
  - Recipe import page
    - With ability to customize each field
    - Auto-populate fields from URL import
    - Export/archive for backup
